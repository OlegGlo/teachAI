TeachAI is a React application that uses the OpenAI API in order to generate a step-by-step
plan on how to teach others any given concept or skill. This web application was designed to be
accessible for any user, simply requiring a text prompt to be entered before a response is returned.
Once a response is returned, users can clarify certain steps by clicking on them to fetch more
detailed instructions to ensure user understanding of the information. Use TeachAI and start developing
your lesson plans today.
